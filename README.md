# Overview
*In this section give a broad overview of the project goals and plan*

- **Academic Year**: 2019-2020
- **Project Title**: AppIchetto: a smartphone application for managing tickets and costs sharing 
- **Students**: Giuseppe Palazzolo and Federico Vaccaro
- **CFUs**: 6


In this project we implemented a web application which allows the users to import
long receipts from external sources (pdf documents or images), to split the expenses between the friends,
keeping track of the debts and ultimately to allow the users to pay the debts. We developed our
we application with a large focus on smartphone devices, which we found more suitable for letting 
 the user to quickly accomplishing the given tasks and design the interfaces through well-known elements. 
 
# Tools and Techniques
*In this section list the tools and any special techniques you will employ.*

The main tools and techniques employed are:
- **Ionic V5** \[1\]: For building the UI with components using the Material design, which is based on 
- **Google Angular** \[2\]: core framework base on TypeScript for developing the front-end side of web applications
- **Firebase** \[3\]: NoSQL cloud database for storing the needed informations from the users

# Expected Outcomes
We expect to:
- Hugely speed-up the procedure of costs sharing through a simple interface, which is slow, 
boring and error prone where there are a lot of items to differently share among more friends; 
- Simplify the tracking of debts and credits between users, and to provide a simple tool for summarizing and
 checking the history between the users.
